# Adv-Home-Automation

This repository contains codes for raspberry pi, website for controlling devices, sensor configurartionsetc.

In this world of technology interacting with an object by approaching it sounds pretty
much tedious and lame. This project is a prototype of home automation model. What our
project does is :
1. You can control all the appliances by interacting with them by voice instead of
approaching them and turning them on.
2. You can also control all the appliances remotely via mobiles or laptop.
3. It automatically turn off all the appliance turned on by the user when he/she
leaves the room, and also saves the state of the appliance when the user
left.When the user again enters the room all the appliances which are turned on
by the user will get on automatically.This would be used when the user enters
again. IR sensors helps keep count of the people inside the room.
4. We have included a feature in which you have to enter a combination of
digits(the password you set) to turn on/off the security in the house.
5. There is a camera which captures images if a motion is detected and the security
system is in “ON” state.
